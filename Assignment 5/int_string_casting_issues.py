I talked a lot about helping but not fixing the problem
In this code, if you run this and enter not an integer, it throws an error, as we're aware, as you solved this problem in the debug file
can you google a way to help or even fix this problem that isn't the way we were doing it before?

def main():
    intInput = int(input("Enter an int (but enter a string to see the error)"))
    
main()
