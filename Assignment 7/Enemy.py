'''
Create an enemy class with health.
create a goblin child class with a function called "attack" that says "the gobllin gobbles"
create a wizard child class that also has a 'magicType' variable (wizards use different types of magic!) and their attack function should tell the user what type of magic they've been hit with!

(there should be no main, unless you want to test these classes- i'm not expecting you to use them, I would just like to see correctly build classes and functions!)
